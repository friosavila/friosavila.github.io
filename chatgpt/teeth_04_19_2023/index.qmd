ChatGPT was requested to write a poem about Abigail's first tooth. The first one was a horror one, but I like this second one better
:::

Abigail's first teeth, oh so small

Pearly white, they barely show at all

But they bring joy to all who see

This precious little one, so full of glee

\

Abigail drools and chews with delight

Her first teeth, such a wonderful sight

She smiles and giggles with every sound

As she explores the world all around

\ 

Her first teeth, a milestone so sweet

A sign of growth and development complete

They mark the start of her journey ahead

As Abigail grows, learns and is fed

\

So let's celebrate Abigail's first teeth

And all the joy and wonder they bequeath

For they are a precious part of life's start

And a sign of the love in our hearts.

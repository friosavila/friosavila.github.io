Hi, I can see you are interested in some of the programs I have written over the years.
I have quite a few that are available from SSC. However, I recently open my own repository

<https://github.com/friosavila/stpackages>

It will contain the most uptodate versions of my packages, that come with its own installer!

See [how to write your own installer](https://friosavila.github.io/chatgpt/fra_03_30_2023/)

If you encounter any problems. Let me know.

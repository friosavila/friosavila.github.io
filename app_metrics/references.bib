For example, the technique is often used to analyze wage gaps by sex or race.

The recent literature suggests that this relationship might be non-linear. Low levels of innovation will not affect economic growth; yet, when a certain threshold is reached, innovation significantly promotes economic growth. Using panel data information for 147 countries from 2006 to 2012, we employ threshold regressions à la Hansen (1999) to test the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between innovation and growth. We find evidence that the relationship between innovation and growth is not linear and that only high levels of innovation increase economic growth. The results tend to be stronger when investment and public expenditure are present, suggesting that the quality of institutions is important.},

While several studies have found that these two variables are positively correlated, others have not been able to find conclusive results. We contend that a partial explanation resides on institutional differences among host countries. We find that increases in IPR protection encourage FDI in countries in which the institutional environment, as proxied by indices of economic freedom, is efficient but not otherwise. We use threshold regression techniques on samples ranging from 81 to 102 countries during the 1990 - 2010 period.},

Design/methodology/approach This analysis employs an instrumental variable with a Heckman correction approach to account for possible endogeneity problems between IPV and job exit decisions, and the self-selection of women into the labor force. It also analyses the sample across different population characteristics to search for heterogeneity and potential explanations to the observed effects. Findings The results show that the effect of IPV on women’s job exits is stronger among non-indigenous women compared to their indigenous counterparts. These differences could be tied to the cultural differences between these two segments of the population. These results are robust using different methodologies and specifications. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first one to compare the relationship between domestic violence and labor market outcomes in a multi-ethnic developing country, such as Bolivia.},

In light of such discrepancies, this paper reviews how to implement and interpret a range of LR, CQR, and UQR models with fixed effects. It also discusses the use of Quantile Treatment Effect (QTE) models as an alternative to overcome some of the limitations of CQR and UQR models. We then review how to interpret results in the presence of fixed effects based on a replication of Budig and Hodges?s work on the motherhood penalty using NLSY79 data.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper examines the level and structure of the wage inequality between nonrefugee and refugee workers in Palestine and the extent to which such wage gap reflects any marginalization and discrimination against refugees. It also investigates how the disparities in distribution to individual worker characteristics contribute to the wage inequality in Palestine. Design/methodology/approach The authors use both Oaxaca and Blinder (OB) (Oaxaca, 1973 and Blinder, 1973) and Fortin et al. (2011) unconditional quantile decomposition approaches to measure the size of the wage gap along with the wage distribution and to decompose the wage differences into productivity (i.e. explained or the composition effects) and wage structure effects (i.e. unexplained or discrimination effects). Findings Results indicate that most of the wage gap between refugees and nonrefugees is attributed to the wage structure effect (possibly explained by discrimination) against refugees in the Palestinian labor market. The wage gap between refugees and nonrefugees is not uniform throughout the wage distribution and supports the “sticky floor effect.” Practical implications This work introduces important policy implications for the policymakers in the Palestinian labor market. It reveals the economic and social factors, individual worker characteristics as well as labor market characteristics contribute to the wage inequality in Palestine. Social implications This research reveals a crucial social challenge in the Palestinian society, represented by the wage discrimination against refugees in Palestine. This is despite the denial of such discrimination from official bodies, local institutions and many other policymakers. It also captures gender inequality between men and women. Originality/value This is the first empirical work in Palestine that contends with a very sensitive issue in the Palestinian society, that is, the discrimination against refugees in the Palestinian labor market. Most of the existing studies have approached this issue from a humanitarian view in order to show the deterioration of social and economic situations in the refugee camps.},

We present a detailed exposition of the Guell and Hu (GH) strategy and show a Monte Carlo simulation for unemployment duration where the GH method produces better estimates compared to panel data with individual matching errors. We further apply the GH model to examine the immigrant unemployment duration in the USA using the Current Population Survey data from 2001 to 2013 and focus on the role of the birth-country networks on the unemployment duration around the Great Recession. We find that birth-country networks measured at the state level significantly lower unemployment duration for all immigrants, and this effect is stronger during the pre- and post-recession periods than during the recession. We also find that networks are more effective in lowering duration for immigrants unemployed for 1–2 months than for immigrants who are unemployed for longer periods, and this effect is the strongest during the post-recession period. The findings are robust to different specifications and measures of networks including those measured at the local MSA level.},

	abstract = {Recentered influence functions (RIFs) are statistical tools popularized by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009, Econometrica 77: 953?973) for analyzing unconditional partial effects on quantiles in a regression analysis framework (unconditional quantile regressions). The flexibility and simplicity of these tools have opened the possibility to extend the analysis to other distributional statistics using linear regressions or decomposition approaches. In this article, I introduce one function and two commands to facilitate the use of RIFs in the analysis of outcome distributions: rifvar is an egen extension used to create RIFs for a large set of distributional statistics, rifhdreg facilitates the estimation of RIF regressions enabling the use of high-dimensional fixed effects, and oaxaca\_rif implements Oaxaca?Blinder decomposition analysis (RIF decompositions).},

Using U.S. data, we find an average annualized expected dollar equivalent welfare loss of \$1,156 when the unemployment rate rises by one-percentage point. Relative to single families, the welfare loss is greater for married families and increases with education. We also estimate that a loss in purchasing power of 1.8\% generates the same amount of welfare loss as a one percentage point rise in the unemployment rate. Additionally, the magnitude of the shock to purchasing power that a family is willing to endure to avoid a one percentage point increases in the aggregate unemployment rate rises with income. The results in this paper informs policy makers about the distributional implications of decisions likely to affect labor markets.},

The losses in terms of employment and earnings are matched only by the losses in terms of real wealth. In many ways, however, these losses are merely a continuation of trends that have been unfolding for more than two decades. We examine the changes in overall economic well-being and inequality, as well as changes in racial economic inequality during and since the Great Recession. We find that the Levy Institute Measure of Economic Well-Being inequality between White and Black households decreased during the Great Recession but since 2010, racial inequality in terms of LIMEW has increased. We find that changes in base income, taxes, and income from non-home wealth during the Great Recession produced declines in overall inequality, while only taxes reduced between-group racial inequality.},

The flexibility of this methodology may allow detecting heterogeneity when analyzing endogenous dose treatments effects, as well as correcting for endogeneity when analyzing the heterogeneous partial effects across the continuous group variable. For illustration, the methodology is used to revisit the impact of body weight on wages, using body mass index (BMI) as the continuum of groups, finding evidence that body weight has a negative, but decreasing impact on wages for both white men and women.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Bolivia has experienced a series of economic and political transformations that have directly affected the labor markets, particularly the salaried urban sector. Real wages have shown strong increases across the distribution, while also presenting a decrease in inequality. Using an intertemporal decomposition approach, we find evidence that changes in demographic and labor market characteristics can explain only a small portion of the observed inequality decline. Instead, the results indicate that the decline in wage inequality was driven by the faster wage growth of usually low-paid jobs, and wage stagnation of jobs that require higher education or are in traditionally highly paid fields. While the evidence shows that the reduction in inequality is significant, we suggest that such an improvement might not be sustainable in the long run, since structural factors associated with productivity, such as workers’ level of education, explain only a small portion of these wage changes. This suggests that enhanced redistributive policies accompanied by long-term structural policies aimed to increase productivity and educational level should be implemented in order to maintain the trends.},

This paper aims to investigate the effect of banking crises on investment finding a prolonged negative effect. Design/methodology/approach The authors test to see whether investment declines after a banking crisis and, if it does, for how long and by how much. The paper uses data for 148 countries from 1963 to 2007. Econometrically, the authors test how banking crises episodes affect investment in future years after controlling for other potential determinants. Findings The authors find that the investment to GDP ratio is on average about 1.7 percent lower for about eight years following a banking crisis. These results are robust after controlling for credit availability, institutional characteristics, and a host of other factors. Furthermore, the authors find that the size and duration of this adverse effect on investment varies according to the level of financial development of a country. The largest and longer-lasting decrease in investment is found in countries in a middle region of financial development, where finance plays its most important role according to theory. Originality/value The authors contribute by finding that banking crisis can have long-term effects on investment of up to nine years. Further, the authors contribute by finding that the level of development of the country's financial markets affects the duration of this decrease in investment.},

	abstract = {In the last three decades, armed conflict has increasingly been fought among civilian populations, resulting in greater physical and mental tolls. Soldiers returning from combat with psychological trauma are now receiving medical and policy attention for reintegration into the workforce. However, there is little attention on the impacts and options available to civilians who may face similar problems achieving labor force success after exposure to war-related trauma. Using the Bosnia and Herzegovina Living Standards Measurement Survey for years 2001–2004, we study wage attainment for 7659 respondents in relation to a series of psychological trauma measures which correspond to those used in PTSD diagnosis. In standard OLS regression, all subcomponents of PTSD have a negative impact; however, once unobserved individual heterogeneity is taken into account, some of the individual elements of psychological trauma have positive impacts on wage attainment. This is one of the first studies to find evidence of Posttraumatic Growth using information beyond psychometric instruments. The impact of the PTSD condition itself is insignificant in both models, and we do not find evidence of selection bias. We determine that the traditional means of predicting wages in labor economics are relevant in a post-conflict environment.},

The measured impact can differ greatly from simple marginal tax rate comparisons, and conclusions about the distribution of the welfare impact can vary depending on the basis of comparison. For example, absolute welfare gains from the 2001 U.S. tax reform were concentrated among the highest and lowest income families, whereas welfare gains measured as a share of pre-tax income are found to be nearly monotonically declining in income.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators.

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},

The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

We then derive the efficient estimator addressing this challenge, which takes an intuitive "imputation" form when treatment-effect heterogeneity is unrestricted. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Extensions include time-varying controls, triple-differences, and certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of these insights in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter -- about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models -- and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

First, I provide some simple underlying intuition for why difference-in-differences regression does not identify a group\${\textbackslash}times\$period average treatment effect. Second, I propose an alternative two-stage estimation framework, motivated by this intuition. In this framework, group and period effects are identified in a first stage from the sample of untreated observations, and average treatment effects are identified in a second stage by comparing treated and untreated outcomes, after removing these group and period effects. The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-effect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of different average treatment effect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement. I establish the theoretical properties of the two-stage approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability using Monte-Carlo evidence and an example from the literature.},

It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like ‘what to do if there is choice-based sampling?’ or ‘when to measure effects?’ can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes.},

Censored observations are multiply imputed using draws from a flexible parametric model fitted to the censored distribution, yielding a partially synthetic data set from which point and variance estimates can be derived using complete-data methods and appropriate combination formulae. The methods are illustrated using US Current Population Survey data and the generalized beta of the second kind distribution as the imputation model. With Current Population Survey internal data, we find few statistically significant differences in income inequality for pairs of years between 1995 and 2004. We also show that using Current Population Survey public use data with cell mean imputations may lead to incorrect inferences. Multiply-imputed public use data provide an intermediate solution.},

	abstract = {Researchers studying income inequality, economic segregation, and other subjects must often rely on grouped data?that is, data in which thousands or millions of observations have been reduced to counts of units by specified income brackets. The distribution of households within the brackets is unknown, and highest incomes are often included in an open-ended top bracket, such as ?\$200,000 and above.? Common approaches to this estimation problem include calculating midpoint estimators with an assumed Pareto distribution in the top bracket and fitting a flexible multiple-parameter distribution to the data. The authors describe a new method, mean-constrained integration over brackets (MCIB), that is far more accurate than those methods using only the bracket counts and the overall mean of the data. On the basis of an analysis of 297 metropolitan areas, MCIB produces estimates of the standard deviation, Gini coefficient, and Theil index that are correlated at 0.997, 0.998, and 0.991, respectively, with the parameters calculated from the underlying individual record data. Similar levels of accuracy are obtained for percentiles of the distribution and the shares of income by quintiles of the distribution. The technique can easily be extended to other distributional parameters and inequality statistics.},

	abstract = {Background: Survey-based research finds a sizeable unexplained wage gap between mothers and nonmothers in affluent countries. The source of this wage gap is unclear: It can stem either from the unobserved effects of motherhood on productivity or from employer discrimination against mothers.

Objective: This paper opens the black box of the motherhood wage gap by directly measuring discrimination in Switzerland based on two complementary methods.

Methods: We first use two longitudinal population surveys to establish the size of the wage residual for motherhood. We then run a factorial survey experiment among HR managers (N=714) whom we asked to assign a starting wage to the résumés of fictitious job candidates.

Results: The population surveys show an unexplained wage penalty per child of 4\% to 8\%. The factorial survey experiment shows that recruiters assign wages to mothers that are 2\% to 3\% below those of nonmothers. The wage penalty is larger for younger mothers, 6\% for ages 40 and less, but disappears for older mothers or mothers in a blue-collar occupation.

Conclusions: The motherhood wage gap found in panel studies cannot be reduced to unobserved dimensions of work productivity. The experimental evidence shows that recruiters discriminate against mothers.

Contribution: Our paper’s novelty is to uncover wage discrimination against mothers by combining two different methods. Our national panel surveys mirror the supply side of the labor market and provide us with strong external validity. The factorial survey experiment on recruiters informs on the demand side of the labor market and shows a causal effect.},

We establish wage penalties for motherhood between 9\% and 18\% per child, with wage losses among American and British mothers being lower than those experienced by mothers in Germany. Labor market mechanisms generating the observed wage penalty for motherhood differ markedly across countries, however. For British and American women, work interruptions and subsequent mobility into mother-friendly jobs fully account for mothers’ wage losses. In contrast, respective penalties are considerably smaller in Germany, yet we observe a substantial residual wage penalty that is unaccounted for by mothers’ observable labor market behavior. We interpret this finding as indicating a comparatively more pronounced role for statistical discrimination against mothers in the German labor market.},

These policies provide a natural experiment from which we can better understand the effect that e-cigarettes have on youth combustible tobacco use. This paper uses National Youth Tobacco Survey data to estimate the effect of the gradual roll-out of e-cigarette MLSAs in the United States on youth e-cigarette use, cigarette use, and cigar use (i.e., cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars). Using an estimator designed to correct for dynamic heterogeneity in treatment effects, e-cigarette MLSAs are estimated to reduce lifetime e-cigarette use by approximately 25\% and increase daily cigarette use and daily cigar use by approximately 35\%. Therefore, these MLSAs operate as intended in reducing e-cigarette use, although at the expense of more dangerous combustible tobacco use. The Food and Drug Administration should consider the impact of e-cigarette availability in reducing youth combustible tobacco use as an important public health benefit of e-cigarettes in their regulatory activity.},

However, we estimate sizable positive cigarette cross-tax effects, suggesting economic substitution between cigarettes and ENDS for youth. These substitution effects are particularly large for frequent cigarette smoking.

First, we assess the effects of different graphical representation methods on visual inference using randomized experiments. We find that bin widths and fit lines have the largest impacts on whether participants correctly perceive the presence or absence of a discontinuity. Our experimental results allow us to make evidence-based recommendations to practitioners, and we suggest using small bins with no fit lines as a starting point to construct RD graphs. Second, we compare visual inference on graphs constructed using our preferred method with widely used econometric inference procedures.

However, the standard econometric framework for clustering leaves important questions unanswered: (i) Why do we adjust standard errors for clustering in some ways but not others, for example, by state but not by gender, and in observational studies but not in completely randomized experiments? (ii) Is the clustered variance estimator valid if we observe a large fraction of the clusters in the population? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism. We show that, when the number of clusters in the sample is a nonnegligible fraction of the number of clusters in the population, conventional clustered standard errors can be severely inflated, and propose new variance estimators that correct for this bias.},

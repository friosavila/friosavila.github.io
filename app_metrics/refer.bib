    abstract = { In this article, we introduce the qmodel command, which fits parametric models for the conditional quantile function of an outcome variable given covariates. Ordinary quantile regression, implemented in the qreg command, is a popular, simple type of parametric quantile model. It is widely used but known to yield erratic estimates that often lead to uncertain inferences. Parametric quantile models overcome these limitations and extend modeling of conditional quantile functions beyond ordinary quantile regression. These models are flexible and efficient. qmodel can estimate virtually any possible linear or nonlinear parametric model because it allows the user to specify any combination of qmodel-specific built-in functions, standard mathematical and statistical functions, and substitutable expressions. We illustrate the potential of parametric quantile models and the use of the qmodel command and its postestimation commands through realand simulated-data examples that commonly arise in epidemiological and pharmacological research. In addition, this article may give insight into the close connection that exists between quantile functions and the true mathematical laws that generate data. }

abstract = {We study the conditions under which it is possible to estimate regression quantiles by estimating conditional means. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the use of methods that are only valid in the estimation of conditional means, while still providing information on how the regressors affect the entire conditional distribution. The methods we propose are not meant to replace the well-established quantile regression estimator, but provide an additional tool that can allow the estimation of regression quantiles in settings where otherwise that would be difficult or even impossible. We consider two settings in which our approach can be particularly useful: panel data models with individual effects and models with endogenous explanatory variables. Besides presenting the estimator and establishing the regularity conditions needed for valid inference, we perform a small simulation experiment, present two simple illustrative applications, and discuss possible extensions.}

abstract = {The penalized least squares interpretation of the classical random effects estimator suggests a possible way forward for quantile regression models with a large number of “fixed effects”. The introduction of a large number of individual fixed effects can significantly inflate the variability of estimates of other covariate effects. Regularization, or shrinkage of these individual effects toward a common value can help to modify this inflation effect. A general approach to estimating quantile regression models for longitudinal data is proposed employing ℓ1 regularization methods. Sparse linear algebra and interior point methods for solving large linear programs are essential computational tools.}

    abstract = { In this article, I introduce the sivqr command, which estimates the coefficients of the instrumental variables quantile regression model introduced by Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005, Econometrica 73: 245–261). The sivqr command offers several advantages over the existing ivqreg and ivqreg2 commands for estimating this instrumental variables quantile regression model, which complements the alternative “triangular model” behind cqiv and the “local quantile treatment effect” model of ivqte. Computationally, sivqr implements the smoothed estimator of Kaplan and Sun (2017, Econometric Theory 33: 105–157), who show that smoothing improves both computation time and statistical accuracy. Standard errors are computed analytically or by Bayesian bootstrap; for nonindependent and identically distributed sampling, sivqr is compatible with bootstrap. I discuss syntax and the underlying methodology, and I compare sivqr with other commands in an example. }

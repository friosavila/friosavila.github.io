Over the last few weeks, they have been pushing quite few updates, and finally they have released version 1.4. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to me is that this version includes a new feature that I have been waiting for a while: Multi source cross-referencing!\n\nI have been using Quarto for some time now, and one of the things I noticed is that it was very easy to add titles and cross-references to tables as long as they were formated as markdown tables. \n\nHowever, as you may now, markdown tables are not very flexible. Better options include HTML tables, and even better, LaTeX tables. Unfortunately, there was no easy way to reference those kinds of tables using the `@ref` syntax. Looking at other people's questions and solutions, they all seemed a bit complicated to me. (specially those that involved using LaTeX commands).\n\nBut now, with version 1.4, it seems very easy to reference tables that are not markdown tables!\n\nLet's see how it works!\n\n## Setup\n\nTo do this, I will produce a simple regression using `Stata`, and export it as markdown, HTML, and LaTeX tables using `esttab`^[`esttab` is part of `estout` package by Ben Jann.]. \n\n```stata\n*| code-fold: false\n*| echo: true\nfrause oaxaca, clear\nqui:reg  lnwage educ exper tenure female\nest sto m1\nqui:reg  lnwage educ exper tenure female age agesq married divorced\nest sto m2\n\nesttab m1 m2 using \"reg1\", wide se replace md\nesttab m1 m2 using \"reg1\", wide se replace html\nesttab m1 m2 using \"reg1\", wide se replace tex\n```\n\nThe output of the code is not usable right away, as it has some minor issues. For example, the markdown table has an extra line that needs to be removed. \n\nFor the next I will make it simple, using what I think is the easiest cross reference the tables:\n\n\n```{markdown}\n::: {#tbl-table1}\n\n|              |          (1)                  |              |          (2)                  |              |\n| ------------ | :---------------------------: | :----------: | :---------------------------: | :----------: |\n| educ         |       0.0848<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00519) |       0.0644<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00508) |\n| exper        |       0.0111<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00154) |    -0.000311                  |    (0.00181) |\n| tenure       |      0.00771<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00188) |      0.00672<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00190) |\n| female       |      -0.0841<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |     (0.0251) |       -0.160<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |     (0.0243) |\n| age          |                               |              |        0.113<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00814) |\n| agesq        |                               |              |     -0.00126<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |  (0.0000976) |\n| married      |                               |              |      -0.0224                  |     (0.0294) |\n| divorced     |                               |              |       0.0719                  |     (0.0412) |\n| \\_cons       |        2.213<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |     (0.0683) |        0.311<sup>\\*</sup>     |      (0.149) |\n| *N*          |         1434                  |              |         1434                  |              |\n\n\n\n\nTable made with markdown\n\n:::\n```\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-table1}\n\n|              |          (1)                  |              |          (2)                  |              |\n| ------------ | :---------------------------: | :----------: | :---------------------------: | :----------: |\n| educ         |       0.0848<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00519) |       0.0644<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00508) |\n| exper        |       0.0111<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00154) |    -0.000311                  |    (0.00181) |\n| tenure       |      0.00771<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00188) |      0.00672<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00190) |\n| female       |      -0.0841<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |     (0.0251) |       -0.160<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |     (0.0243) |\n| age          |                               |              |        0.113<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |    (0.00814) |\n| agesq        |                               |              |     -0.00126<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |  (0.0000976) |\n| married      |                               |              |      -0.0224                  |     (0.0294) |\n| divorced     |                               |              |       0.0719                  |     (0.0412) |\n| \\_cons       |        2.213<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup> |     (0.0683) |        0.311<sup>\\*</sup>     |      (0.149) |\n| *N*          |         1434                  |              |         1434                  |              |\n\n\n\n\n\nTable made with markdown\n\n:::\n\n",

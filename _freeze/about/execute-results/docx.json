This website is multipurpose.\n\nI started it to answer random questions of \"how to\" do things in Stata, that I had troubles with at some point. Spread the knowledge if you may. However it will also be used as a teaching tool for some simple and not-so-simple topics and strategies I teach in econometrics class.\n\nFinally, I will also use it as a platform to share my research, whenever possible, and pertinent.\n\nFeel free to drop me a line, comment or question.\n\nPerhaps most interesting of all. This site was rewritten, again, using Quarto! combined with **`Stata`**!\n\nYou can find me at: <friosa@gmail.com>\n\nOr follow me on tweeter: [@friosavila](https://twitter.com/friosavila)\n\nAnd just to start with.

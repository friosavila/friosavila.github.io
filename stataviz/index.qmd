title: "Stata Vizualizations"
---

Welcome to the data visualization section, where I explore the power of data visualization in Stata. Effective data visualization is essential for conveying insights and communicating results to diverse audiences. 

While Stata is a statistical software first, graphics software second, it does offer sufficient flexiblity, tools and options for creating informative data visualizations, although not without extra work.

On this webpage, I will compile a collection Stata programs that I have written for data visualization that will help you create visually appealing graphics for your research projects. I hope you will find these codes helpful in creating informative charts, histograms, scatterplots, and more.

As a data visualization enthusiast and Stata user, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and skills with others. I believe that effective data visualization is crucial in conveying research findings and engaging audiences, but most importantly, programming them allows me to sharpen my skills!
